				<h2>6181 Crypic Cyborgs</h2>
				<p>
					I participate in a FIRST robotics team at Northwest State Community College called the Crypic Cyborgs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the 2022 Season we placed 8th in the Northern Ohio Area out of 61 teams using our robot <em>Rex</em>.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Challenges in the 2022 Season included:
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Throwing 9.5 inch balls 8 feet into the air into hoops.</li>
					<li>Hanging your ~150 pound robot from one of 4 different bars near your starting area.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					My role on the team is to do a mixture of physical electrical work, and doing programming to control the robot.
