				<h2>6181 Crypic Cyborgs</h2>
				<p>
					I participate in a FIRST robotics team at Northwest State Community College called the Crypic Cyborgs.

					In the 2022 Season we placed 8th in the Northern Ohio Area out of 61 teams using our robot <em>Rex</em>.

					Challenges in the 2022 Season included:
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Throwing 9.5 inch balls 8 feet into the air into hoops.</li>
					<li>Hanging your ~150 pound robot from one of 4 different bars near your starting area.</li>
