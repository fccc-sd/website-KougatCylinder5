				<ul>
					<!-- My Hobbies-->

					<li>Programming</li>
					<li>First Robotics Competion Team</li>
					<li>Video Games</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Current Schooling</h4>
				<p>I am currently a student at Four County Career Center taking IT accademy.</p>
				<p>My teacher has a <a href = 'https://mrgeiger.com'>website</a> himself that he uses to post assignments for us to do along with help pages we might need.</p>
				<h4>Video Games I Play:</h5>
				<p>
					<!-- List of Games I play-->
					<em> <a href = 'https://klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included'>Oxygen Not Included</a></em>,
					<em> <a href = 'https://factorio.com'> Factorio</a></em>,
					<em> <a href = 'https://screeps.com'>Screeps</a></em>,
					<em> War Thunder</em>, and
					<a href = 'https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com'><em> Kerbal Space Program.</em></a>
				</p>
				<p>
					I combine two of my hobbies, programming and video games
					for two of the entries in that list, <em>Kerbal Space Program</em>,
					and <em>Screeps</em>.
				</p>
				<p><!-- KSP Info-->
					Kerbal Space Program is a game about flying rocketships to other planets
					with little green men. Modders inside the community have created a tool
					that allows you to create scripts using a custom programming language that
					can control the rockets autonomously.
				</p>
				<p><!-- Screeps Info-->
					Screeps is an MMO game that you control little creeps with Javascript throughout
					rooms to harvest energy and expand and grow larger. The game runs on a tick system
					where the game runs, everyone's scripts make all the changes to memory and the
					world, does it and starts again. The game has on average 21,000 concurrent players
					and as such it can take upwards of 5 seconds per tick.
				</p>
				<p>
					I play all of these games far too much which is what got me interested in programming
					in the first place alongside wanting to improve my skills for use inside our Robotics Team.
