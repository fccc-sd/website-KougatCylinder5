					<h4>Video Games I Play:</h5>
					<p>
						<!-- List of Games I play-->
						<em> <a href = 'https://klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included'>Oxygen Not Included</a></em>,
						<em> <a href = 'https://factorio.com'> Factorio</a></em>,
						<em> <a href = 'https://screeps.com'>Screeps</a></em>,
						<em> War Thunder</em>, and
						<a href = 'https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com'><em> Kerbal Space Program.</em></a>
					</p>
					<p>
						I combine two of my hobbies, programming and video games
						for two of the entries in that list, <em>Kerbal Space Program</em>,
						and <em>Screeps</em>.
					</p>
					<p><!-- KSP Info-->
						Kerbal Space Program is a game about flying rocketships to other planets
						with little green men. Modders inside the community have created a tool
						that allows you to create scripts using a custom programming language that
						can control the rockets autonomously.
					</p>
					<p><!-- Screeps Info-->
						Screeps is an MMO game that you control little creeps with Javascript throughout
						rooms to harvest energy and expand and grow larger. The game runs on a tick system
						where the game runs, everyone's scripts make all the changes to memory and the
						world, does it and starts again. The game has on average 21,000 concurrent players
						and as such it can take upwards of 5 seconds per tick.
					</p>
					<p>
						I play all of these games far too much which is what got me interested in programming
						in the first place alongside wanting to improve my skills for use inside our Robotics Team.
