		<h4>My Friends</h4>
		<p>My two clossts friend are Andy Mosier and Ethan Winger we hang out occassionally and play some videogames together when we can.</p>
		<h4>I have many hobbies which include but aren't limited to:</h4>
		<ul>
			<!-- My Hobbies-->
			<li>Reading</li>
			<li>Programming</li>
			<li>First Robotics Competion Team</li>
			<li>Video Games</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Video Games I Play:</h5>
		<p>
			<!-- List of Games I play-->
			<em>Oxygen Not Included</em>,<em> Factorio</em>,
			<em> Screeps</em>,<em> War Thunder</em>, and
			<em> Kerbal Space Program.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			I combine two of my hobbies, programming and video games
			for two of the entries in that list, <em>Kerbal Space Program</em>,
			and <em>Screeps</em>.
		</p>
		<p><!-- KSP Info-->
			Kerbal Space Program is a game about flying rocketships to other planets
			with little green men. Modders inside the community have created a tool
			that allows you to create scripts using a custom programming language that
			can control the rockets autonomously.
		</p>
		<p><!-- Screeps Info-->
			Screeps is an MMO game that you control little creeps with Javascript throughout
			rooms to harvest energy and expand and grow larger. The game runs on a tick system
			where the game runs, everyone's scripts make all the changes to memory and the
			world, does it and starts again. The game has on average 21,000 concurrent players
			and as such it can take upwards of 5 seconds per tick.
		</p>
		<p>
			I play all of these games far too much which is what got me interested in programming
			in the first place alongside wanting to improve my skills for use inside our Robotics Team.
